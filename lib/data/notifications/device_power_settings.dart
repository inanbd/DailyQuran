/// Battery optimisation is the reason a reminder that was scheduled correctly
/// still never arrives. Android — and, far more aggressively, several
/// manufacturer skins on top of it — will put an app it considers idle to
/// sleep and drop its pending alarms with it. Asking for the exemption raises
/// the system's own "Allow app to always run in the background?" dialog; the
/// reader decides, and the app carries on either way.
///
/// Every method is best-effort. On iOS, on a platform without the host side
/// registered, or if the OS simply refuses, the call reports "no" rather than
/// throwing: reminders are an accessory, and reading must never break because
/// a power setting could not be read.
